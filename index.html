  <p>Last, but certainly not least, is Moat Lagoon.
  <br />This is one of the most difficult beach locations to access.
  <br />The lagoon is located inside of a prehistoric cenote, or underground aquifer.
  <br />Accessing it involves crossing the moat surrounding the lagoon (hence the name) with locals
  <br />by kayak. Once there, marvel at the phenomenal (and endangered) quetzal bird and its golden feathers.</p>
